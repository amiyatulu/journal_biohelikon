	 <h3>Aims &amp; Scope</h3><p>Immunity- the state of protection from infectious diseases-has both a less specific and more specific component. The less specific component, innate immunity, provides the first line of defense against infection. Phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, barriers such as skin, and a variety of antimicrobial compounds synthesized by the host all play important roles in innate immunity. Adaptive immunity does not come into play until there is an antigenic challenge to the organism.  Adaptive immunity responds to challenge with a high degree of specificity as well as the remarkable property of “memory”.</p>
